# projectDL2025
Course project for EC523: Deep Learning (Fall 2025, Boston University). This project, “Real Time Image Classification for Generalized Moderation of Content,” implements and evaluates deep learning models for automated detection and moderation of visual content in real time.

classifierHeadNaive - a preliminary implementation of the new decoder which will produce a set of probabilities. If any probability is high enough, it will result in a nonzero vector output which will be used to moderate the content
